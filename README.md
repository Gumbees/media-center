# Media Center Stack

This is a comprehensive media center solution that combines various services for managing, downloading, and streaming media content. The stack is containerized using Docker and includes the following services:

## Hardware Requirements

This stack is configured to run on a ROCKCHIP device, utilizing hardware acceleration for improved media transcoding performance. The configuration includes specific device mappings for:
- DRI (Direct Rendering Infrastructure)
- DMA Heap
- Mali GPU
- RGA (Raster Graphic Acceleration)
- MPP (Media Process Platform)

### Tested Environment

This stack has been tested and verified on the following hardware:

**Orange Pi 5 Plus**
- SoC: Rockchip RK3588 8 Core 64 Bit
- Memory: 16GB
- Features: 2.4GHz Frequency, 8K Video Decoding
- Operating System: Armbian Linux 6.1.99-vendor-rk35xx
- Armbian Version: v25.2.3
- Filesystem: ZFS for system and configuration
- Media Storage: NFS mount for media content

## Features

- Hardware acceleration support for Rockchip devices
- Centralized media storage with volume mapping
- Secure remote access through Cloudflare tunnels
- Automated subtitle downloads
- Integrated request and media management system

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Sufficient storage space for media
- Network connectivity
- ROCKCHIP-compatible device for hardware acceleration (currently configured for ROCKCHIP devices)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your environment file:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp stack.env.example stack.env
   
   # Edit stack.env with your specific configuration
   nano stack.env  # or use your preferred editor
   ```

3. Choose your deployment type:

   For local storage:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.local.yaml up -d
   ```

   For external volume (e.g., NFS):
   ```bash
   # Ensure your external volume exists
   docker compose up -d
   ```

### Optional Features

The stack includes several optional features that can be enabled in your `stack.env`:

1. **Media Storage Options**:
   - **Local Storage**:
     ```bash
     ENABLE_EXTERNAL_MEDIA_VOLUME=false
     MEDIA_BASE=/path/to/your/media
     ```
     Uses a local directory for media storage, mounted through Docker volumes.
     Deploy with: `docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.local.yaml up -d`
   
   - **External Volume**:
     ```bash
     ENABLE_EXTERNAL_MEDIA_VOLUME=true
     MEDIA_VOLUME_NAME=my_external_volume
     ```
     Uses a pre-existing Docker volume (e.g., NFS mount). The volume must be created before starting the stack.
     Deploy with: `docker compose up -d`

2. **Home IoT Network**: Enable to connect Jellyfin to your home automation network
   ```bash
   ENABLE_HOME_IOT_NETWORK=true
   HOME_IOT_NETWORK=my_home_network
   JELLYFIN_IP=192.168.1.100
   ```

3. **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Enable for secure remote access
   ```bash
   ENABLE_CLOUDFLARED=enabled
   CLOUDFLARED_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_tunnel_token
   ```

These features are disabled by default and can be enabled as needed. See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for detailed information about the configuration structure.

## Storage Architecture

The stack uses a layered storage approach:
- **System & Configuration**: ZFS filesystem providing snapshots and data integrity
- **Media Content**: Flexible storage through either:
  - Local directory mounted via Docker volume
  - External Docker volume (e.g., NFS mount)
- **Temporary Data**: Local filesystem for cache and temporary files

This architecture ensures:
- Data integrity through ZFS features
- Flexible media storage options
- Optimal performance for different types of data

## Network Architecture

The stack uses two Docker networks:
- `media_center_apps`: Internal network for service communication
- `home_iot`: External network for home integration

## Support

For issues and feature requests, please open an issue in the repository.

## Further Tips from Contributors

### GUI Deployment with Portainer (by Gumbee)

For those preferring a more graphical approach to deployment, Portainer is recommended:

1. Install and set up Portainer on your system
2. When adding a new stack in Portainer:
   - Copy the contents of `stack.env.example` into "Environment â†’ Advanced"
   - Update the environment variables as needed
   - Either:
     - Copy and paste the `docker-compose.yml` content directly into the stack
     - Or link Portainer to this repository (or your fork)

This method provides a user-friendly interface for managing your media center stack and its environment variables.
